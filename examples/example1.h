	Adds two integers together
	
	Takes in two integers and, using fast math stuff, adds veryLongVariableName to a.
	This function also does some clever memory stuff to make it efficient.
	
	Parameters:
		int a                           = Integer to add to
		const int veryLongVariableName  = Integer to add
			Const ensures this variable is unchanged
	
	Returns an integer
